# Volcorona

![Volcorona](https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/637.png)

This is my second favourite pokemon of all time. And my favourite pokemon in gen 5 pokemon black and white. 


## Pros! 

- fast
- high special attack
- high special defense
- has quiver dance
- signature move has 50% chance to raise special attack by 1 stage (50% more damage per stage)


## Cons
- low physical defense
- 4x weakness to rock

## Team role
Designed to set up with quiver dance and take out as many pokemon before fainting.
